  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    My name is <strong>Hossein Zarezadeh</strong>. I hold an M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering
    (Control Systems). My professional focus lies at the intersection of control engineering,
    machine learning, and data engineering.
  </p>

  <h3>Background & Education</h3>
  <p>
    During my MSc I studied control theory, system identification, and simulation extensively,
    using MATLAB and Simulink for modeling dynamic systems. That foundation gave me a strong
    mathematical and analytical toolkit which I later applied to data-driven problems.
  </p>

  <h3>Machine Learning & Data</h3>
  <p>
    I build and evaluate models using Scikit-Learn for classical ML, as well as TensorFlow and PyTorch
    for deep learning tasks. I design pipelines for data ingestion, cleaning, and feature engineering
    using Pandas, NumPy, and Spark where appropriate. I am experienced with model validation,
    hyper-parameter tuning, and productionizing models.
  </p>

  <h3>MLOps & Data Engineering</h3>
  <p>
    I deploy and monitor models using Docker, MLflow, and CI/CD pipelines. For data engineering
    I have experience with SQL-based systems, ETL pipelines, and orchestration tools such as
    Apache Airflow. I am familiar with Kafka for streaming architectures and Spark for large-scale
    processing.
  </p>

  <h3>Simulation & Control</h3>
  <p>
    I apply control theory and simulation (MATLAB/Simulink) for system modeling and performance analysis.
    Combining simulation with data helps me design robust controllers and predictive maintenance solutions.
  </p>

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p>
    I aim to build reliable, scalable systems that combine domain knowledge from engineering with modern ML
    practices to solve industrial and research problems.
